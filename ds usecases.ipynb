    "Explain the key features of lists in python \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered and Indexed\n",
    "Lists in Python maintain the order of elements. Each item in a list is assigned an index, starting from 0 for the first element.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mutable\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created. This is a key distinction from tuples, which are immutable.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "my_list[1] = 25  # Modifying the second element\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 25, 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can Contain Heterogeneous Elements\n",
    "A single list can hold elements of different data types (integers, strings, floats, etc.).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "mixed_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.14]\n",
    "print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'Hello', 3.14]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dynamic Size\n",
    "Lists can grow and shrink dynamically, as you can add or remove elements without having to declare the size of the list upfront.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",
    "my_list.remove(2)  # Removing an element\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Supports List Slicing\n",
    "Lists can be sliced to access a subset of elements. This feature works similar to string slicing.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Nested Lists (Lists within Lists)\n",
    "Lists can contain other lists, allowing for the creation of multidimensional data structures (e.g., matrices or grids).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "print(nested_list[1][2])  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Built-in Functions and Methods\n",
    "Python provides numerous built-in functions and methods to work with lists:\n",
    "append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.\n",
    "extend(): Appends elements from another list to the current list.\n",
    "insert(): Inserts an element at a specific position.\n",
    "remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "pop(): Removes an element at a given index (or the last element by default).\n",
    "sort(): Sorts the list in place.\n",
    "reverse(): Reverses the list in place.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [3, 1, 2]\n",
    "my_list.sort()\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Supports Iteration\n",
    "You can easily loop over the elements of a list using a for loop.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Comprehensions\n",
    "Python supports list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Supports Various Operations\n",
    "Lists support several operations, including concatenation, repetition, and membership testing (in).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2]\n",
    "list2 = [3, 4]\n",
    "combined = list1 + list2  # Concatenation\n",
    "repeated = list1 * 3  # Repetition\n",
    "print(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(repeated)  # Output: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Lists preserve the order of elements.\n",
    "Mutable: Lists can be changed after creation.\n",
    "Heterogeneous elements: Lists can store multiple data types.\n",
    "Supports slicing and nesting: You can extract parts of a list and nest lists inside each other.\n",
    "Comprehensive methods and operations: Python provides a variety of built-in functions and methods to manipulate lists.\n",
    "Lists in Python are highly versatile and one of the most used data structures due to their flexibility in handling different data types, dynamic size, and rich set of functionalities."
