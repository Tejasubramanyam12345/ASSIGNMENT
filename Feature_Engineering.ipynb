        "\n",
        "**Data Distribution:** Visualizing distributions (e.g., histograms) helps you understand whether your data is skewed, has outliers, or is normally distributed. Many ML algorithms assume a certain distribution of data (e.g., linear models assume normally distributed features).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Relationships Between Variables:** You can analyze how features are correlated or interact with each other (using correlation matrices, scatter plots, pair plots), which can help you identify redundant or irrelevant features.\n",

        "Many real-world datasets come with missing values, which can lead to inaccurate model training if not handled properly.\n",

        "sklearn.preprocessing is a module in scikit-learn (a popular machine learning library in Python) that provides various utilities for data preprocessing. The goal of preprocessing is to transform raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models. This module helps with common tasks like scaling, normalizing, encoding, and handling missing data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Data encoding refers to the process of transforming categorical variables into numerical values so that they can be fed into machine learning models. Most machine learning algorithms require numerical input, so categorical data must be converted into a numerical format. Data encoding is particularly important for models such as **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, **which cannot handle raw categorical data directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several common techniques for encoding categorical data:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Label Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Label encoding transforms categorical labels (strings) into numerical values. Each unique category is assigned a unique integer. This technique is typically used for target labels in classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category in the original feature, indicating whether a particular category is present (1) or not (0). This method is often used for **nominal data** (categorical data without any specific order).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal encoding is similar to label encoding but is specifically used for ordinal categorical data, where the categories have a meaningful order. For example, ratings like \"poor\", \"average\", \"good\" have an inherent order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Binary Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Binary encoding is used for categorical features with a large number of unique categories. It combines aspects of label encoding and one-hot encoding, representing the integer value of each category as a binary number. The binary digits are split into separate columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Frequency Encoding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequency encoding replaces the categories with the frequency or count of their occurrence in the dataset. It is often used when the categories are not ordered but have varying frequencies."
